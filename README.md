# Words-Typing-Game
The project is based on the most popular web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
It is my own solution for a popular words typing game.
## Data Storage
For this purpose internal memory of the browser was chosen. 
## CSS Animations
An important part in here is the animation. When user write down
a word that is the same as this one indicated by program in given
moment - the animation starts. All words start to move in horizontal
direction by one unit.
